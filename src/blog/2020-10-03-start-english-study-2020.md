I started studying English for TOEFL iBT in order to enter an online college University of People. I want to study computer science and get a bachelor's degree in CS.

If we want to work as a software engineer in a country other than Japan, you will always need a degree in CS because you cannot get a work visa if you don't have a degree in CS.The COVID-19 makes it harder and harder to work abroad without a degree.

My goal is to get a TOEFL score of at least 61 by next spring because the score is required for UoP admission is 61.

There is another reason to take the TOEFL exam. It is because I want to make it a milestone in my English learning. I use English everyday at work now but recently my motivation to study English has been low because I didn't have a specific goal and don't know how my English level changing.
I think that studying English for the TOEFL will have a positive impact on my daily work.
